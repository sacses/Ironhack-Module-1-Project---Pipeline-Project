# Ironhack-Module-1-Project---Pipeline-Project


In this pipeline we import the dataset using SQLite connection, after having browsed the provided database from Kaggle and selected desired columns from each table.

Afterwards, this is transformed into a DataFrame using pandas, where features are cleaned from inconsistencies in their records. RegEx is widely used for this purpose and original DataFrame and the resulted cleaned DataFrame is exported for future reference.
